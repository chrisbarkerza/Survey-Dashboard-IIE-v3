My aim is not only to use AI for writing and planning but also to streamline tasks, enhance creativity, and support my work as an educator. I am particularly interested in tools that assist with visual design, data analysis, and productivity. For instance, platforms such as Notion AI and Claude can help with organising ideas and drafting professional documents, while tools like Canva’s Magic Studio or Microsoft Designer are useful for creating engaging visuals and worksheets.  My goal is to set aside regular time to explore these platforms and integrate them meaningfully into my workflow.
